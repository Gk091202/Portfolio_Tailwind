      Designing a portfolio website was both a technical and creative challenge. I wanted it to reflect not just my skills, but also my personality.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      I started by laying out a simple structure using HTML and Tailwind CSS. I made sure the layout was mobile-friendly and easy to navigate.

      The color palette was chosen to evoke trust and clarity. I used animations sparingly to keep it modern but not overwhelming.
